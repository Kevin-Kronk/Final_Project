# EDA

## Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset

You should read about the data and especially about each variable. Many are coded numerically but most are not numeric variables. We'll use the Diabetes_binary as our response variable.

```{r}
# Load in libraries
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Load in Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset
diabetes_data <- read_csv("diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")

diabetes_data
```
